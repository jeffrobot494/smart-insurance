> You know what might be very helpful for the client - is if, after the research step is complete, they could review the companies found and add/edit them.

‚óè That's a brilliant idea! This would add significant value because:

  User Benefits:
  - Catch missed companies - AI research might miss some portfolio companies
  - Remove false positives - Sometimes websites list companies that aren't actually in the portfolio
  - Add known companies - Users often know of companies not listed on the website
  - Correct company names - Fix variations or ensure proper legal names for better matching

  Implementation suggestions:

  After Research Step UI:
  - Editable company list with add/remove buttons
  - Confidence indicators showing how certain the AI was about each company
  - "Add Company" button, no autocomplete
  - Mark as "Exited" checkbox for each company (since users know portfolio status)

  Enhanced Workflow:
  1. Research finds initial company list
  2. User review & edit step (new)
  3. Legal resolution runs on the curated list
  4. Data extraction proceeds

  API Enhancement:
  We'd need a new endpoint like:
  PUT /api/pipeline/:id/companies
  To allow users to update the company list before proceeding to legal resolution.
