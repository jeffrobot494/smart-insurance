Entertainment Partners is widely recognized as a major payroll, production accounting, and incentives company serving the entertainment industry, but no official corporate registry details (e.g., \\\"Entertainment Partners, LLC\\\" or \\\"Entertainment Partners, Inc.\\\") are listed in these sources. For absolute clarity, you would need to consult official business registries (like the California Secretary of State) or the company’s legal filings, as this information is not disclosed on their public-facing content here.\\n\\n## Department of Labor Filings\\n\\nEntertainment Partners (EP) prepares and files payroll tax returns and pays all payroll taxes (including social security, medicare, and unemployment insurance) related to personnel working on productions[2]. This responsibility is part of their services as a payroll provider, but EP operates on behalf of production companies, not as the employer of record. The production company (Producer) is ultimately responsible for ensuring compliance and reimbursing EP for tax liabilities[2].\\n\\nThere is no indication in these results that EP files federal EEO-1 reports directly with the U.S. Department of Labor. SB 1162 in California (effective 2023, with updated guidance in 2025) requires employers—including entertainment production companies—to file pay data reports with the state, even if they are not required to file an EEO-1 federally[1]. This obligation falls on the employer who hires the employees, not the payroll service provider[1]. Thus, while EP processes tax and wage reporting for payroll, statutory employer filings (like EEO-1 or SB 1162 Pay Data Reports) remain the responsibility of the production company, not EP[1][2].\\n\\n## Company Structure\\n\\nThere is no detailed public disclosure of Entertainment Partners’ internal corporate structure in the available search results. The company provides comprehensive payroll and production services, including onboarding, paymaster assignment, and compliance with union and legal requirements[4]. However, the specific hierarchy (e.g., parent companies, subsidiaries, divisions) and internal organization are not described in these sources.\\n\\n## Summary Table\\n\\n| Aspect                   | Details                                                                                                                                          | Source   |\\n|--------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|----------|\\n| Legal Entity Name        | Not specified in search results; \\\"Entertainment Partners\\\" is the business name; check official registries for exact legal entity (e.g., LLC, Inc.)| —        |\\n| Department of Labor Filings | EP files payroll tax returns and pays payroll taxes on behalf of clients, but statutory employer filings (EEO-1, SB 1162) are the client’s duty   | [1][2]   |\\n| Company Structure        | Not detailed in search results; EP offers payroll, tax, and compliance services for productions                                                    | [4]      |\\n\\n## Key Points\\n\\n- **Entertainment Partners’ exact legal entity name is not disclosed in these search results**—consult official business registries for this information.\\n- **EP files payroll tax returns and pays payroll taxes for clients**, but is not responsible for statutory employer filings like EEO-1 or California SB 1162 Pay Data Reports—those remain the employer’s (production company’s) obligation[1][2].\\n- **No information on internal company structure** (parent, subsidiaries, etc.) is provided in these sources.\\n\\nFor the most accurate and current information on Entertainment Partners’ corporate structure and legal registrations, reviewing official business filings or contacting the company directly is recommended.\\n\\nSources:\\n1. https://www.ep.com/ep-now/sb-1162/\\n2. https://www.ep.com/legal/tos-pp/\\n3. https://www.ep.com/support/w-2/\\n4. https://downloads.adc.ep.com/doc/Payroll_Processing_with_EP.pdf\\n5. https://www.ep.com/legal-and-compliance/Labor-Relations-and-Legal-Update-Winter-2022/\\n\\n\\n(Results from Perplexity sonar-pro)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": false\n}"
