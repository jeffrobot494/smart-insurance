As of the latest available disclosures, there is no confirmed public record that Revelstoke Capital Partners acquired or invested in Evolve Med Spa[1][2][3].\\n\\nKey details\\n- Acquisition event: Viper Partners announced it served as exclusive sell-side advisor on the acquisition of Evolve Med Spa by a private equity group, dated April 5, 2024[1]. Healthcare Dealflow summarized the same announcement and likewise did not identify the buyer[2].  \\n- Buyer identity: Neither the Viper Partners press release nor the deal repost identifies the private equity firm by name[1][2].  \\n- Revelstoke portfolio check: Revelstoke Capital Partners’ published investments page does not list Evolve Med Spa among its portfolio companies as of the latest snapshot reviewed[3].  \\n- Related sector activity: Revelstoke has invested in aesthetics/consumer-health platforms (e.g., NakedMD announced later in 2024), but that does not establish ownership of Evolve Med Spa[4]. This is industry context rather than evidence of Evolve ownership.\\n\\nAnswering your query directly\\n- Ownership/acquisition: Evolve Med Spa was acquired by an unnamed private equity buyer announced April 5, 2024[1][2].  \\n- Revelstoke involvement: No public confirmation links Revelstoke Capital Partners to the Evolve Med Spa transaction; Evolve is not on Revelstoke’s disclosed portfolio list[3].  \\n- Investment status today: Post-acquisition, Evolve is private equity–owned, but the sponsor remains undisclosed in cited public sources[1][2]. If you need definitive confirmation, it likely requires direct company press releases or regulatory filings not covered in the above announcements.\\n\\nSources:\\n1. https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/emerging-trends-in-the-med-spa-industry-viper-partners-insightful-advisory-on-evolve-med-spa-transition-302108307.html\\n2. https://healthcaredealflow.com/evolve-med-spa-acquired-by-pe-firm/\\n3. https://www.revelstokecapital.com/investments/\\n4. https://www.stout.com/en/news/stout-advises-nakedmd-growth-investment-revelstoke-capital-partner\\n5. https://media.mcguirewoods.com/publications/2023/Private-Equity-in-Healthcare.pdf\\n\\n\\n(Results from Perplexity sonar-pro)\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": false\n}"
