This could be because:\n1. The company might be too new (acquired in 2025)\n2. The company might file under a different legal name\n3. The company might be part of a larger entity's filing\n\nGiven the company's size (3,300 employees) and the fact that no matches were found, this case would benefit from advanced resolution techniques such as:\n1. Researching the previous owner's name (Lorient Capital)\n2. Checking parent company NexPhase Capital's holdings\n3. Investigating any DBA (Doing Business As) names\n4. Checking state business registration records for other legal names"
