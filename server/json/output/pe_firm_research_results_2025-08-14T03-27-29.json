The Company’s predecessor was founded in 1992 by Dr. Edward J. Kowlowitz, a board certified pain management physician, leading expert in chronic and acute pain management, and international leader in pain related neuromodulation. Dr. Kowlowitz will become chief executive officer and president of APCH, as well as serve as a member of its Board of Directors.\\n\\nHeadquartered in Indianapolis, Indiana, APCH is positioned to be one of the leading comprehensive pain management companies in the Midwest. The Company provides administrative and support services to pain clinics which offer a comprehensive, fully integrated suite of services to address a variety of pain conditions. Treatments include nerve blocks and injections, spinal cord stimulators, intrathecal pain pumps, ketamine infusions, diagnostic imaging services, high complexity toxicology lab services, physical therapy, responsible pain medication management and psychological services. Currently, the practice has five physicians, all board certified by the American Board of Anesthesiology with added qualifications in pain management, six physician extenders, three physical therapists and two mental health providers specializing in pain management. The facilities include three clinics and two ASCs. As part of this partnership and expansion, the practice is undergoing a million dollar expansion and renovation of their platform location in Indianapolis. The flagship practice in Indianapolis will serve as a template for APCH’s patient care model, management structure, best practices and brand strategy as the Company acquires and expands the services of pain management practices throughout the Midwest.\\n\\nEdward Kowlowitz, chief executive officer and president of APCH, commented, “We are committed to continue to deliver world class patient care to individuals suffering from chronic pain. We are thrilled to partner with American Discovery Capital to bring our industry expertise and business model to serve patients in a number of new markets. Given the current milieu surrounding the “opioid crisis” in our country, it is imperative that competent well trained physicians have the resources and support staff necessary to provide evidence based treatment protocols and safe, balanced compassionate care to the millions of patients suffering from chronic pain.”\\n\\nFrank McMahon, a founding partner at ADC, said “Dr. Kowlowitz and his team of highly-skilled physicians, providers and management team have built an incredible pain management practice and have clearly become the market leaders in the population they serve. We look forward to supporting the Company’s growth in the coming years by providing capital, operational expertise and guidance as the Company enters new markets and continues serving the growing population of individuals suffering from chronic pain. APCH plans to bring smaller practices under the APCH quality umbrella and expand their existing service lines to bring this tested vision of effectual, responsible, cost effective pain management to patients throughout the Midwest.\\n\\nIn addition to the growth equity capital provided by ADC, the Company has secured $21 million of committed financing from J.P. Morgan. Financial terms of ADC’s investment were not disclosed.\\n\\nFaegre Baker Daniels, LLP served as legal counsel to Edward Kowlowitz and the predecessor companies to APCH and Bodman PLC served as legal counsel to ADC.\\n\\nABOUT AMERICAN PAIN CONSORTIUM HOLDINGS, LLC\\n\\nAmerican Pain Consortium Holdings, LLC was formed by the contribution of certain assets and operations formerly part of Shadeland Anesthesia & Pain Associates, Inc., P.C., doing business as “Center for Pain Management”, Center for Special Surgery, LLC and Center for Southside Surgery (collectively referred to as “IndyPain”).\\n\\nFounded in 1992 and based in Indianapolis, IN, IndyPain is one of the leading interventional pain management practices in the state of Indiana.
