Since closing we identified and hired three c-suite executives, onboarded two invaluable industry board members, and executed a strategy to nearly double the headcount and revenue over 12 months.” ³\\n\\n#### Kevin Steele\\n\\n#### CEO of DATALINK\\n\\n![Dave Van Name](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2020/01/Dave-Van-Name-testimony-768x768.jpg)\\n\\n“Partnering with Revelstoke significantly accelerated our growth profile.

In addition to having deep healthcare expertise, Revelstoke understands how to effectively partner with physician-led businesses. They are also great partners to management - willing to assist on any initiative or task. With Revelstoke’s help, we acquired 4 additional practices to our group in the first 8 months, nearly doubling the size of our business.“ ³\\n\\n#### Clyde Bell\\n\\n#### CEO of CVP\\n\\n![Greg Steil](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2020/01/Greg-Steil-testimony.jpg)\\n\\n“I have worked with Revelstoke and its partners on three transactions over ten years and have witnessed first-hand Revelstoke's commitment to a shared strategic vision and its willingness to invest in corporate infrastructure to help foster growth.

They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\n\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\"News\\\")\\n\\nURL: https://www.stout.com/en/experience/advised-sale-premier-provider-med-spa-treatments\\nTitle: Advised on sale of premier provider of med spa treatments - Stout\\nDescription: Stout served as exclusive financial advisor to NakedMD in connection with its sale to Revelstoke Capital Partners.\\n\\nContent:\\n[Skip to Content](https://www.stout.com/en/experience/advised-sale-premier-provider-med-spa-treatments#main)\\n\\n![image of woman receiving med spa treatment](https://www.stout.com/-/media/images/experience/nakedmd-hero_adobestock_713926333_opt.jpg?la=en&h=570&w=1508&hash=9D586E8E3FE63F5D3B4D4DA670A49B33)\\n\\n# Advised on sale of premier provider of med spa treatments\\n\\n[Subscribe to Transaction News](https://www.stout.com/en/services/investment-banking/subscribe-to-transaction-news)\\n\\n###### Services\\n\\n- [M&A Advisory](https://www.stout.com/en/services/m-a-advisory)\\n\\n###### Industry\\n\\n- [Healthcare](https://www.stout.com/en/industries/healthcare)\\n\\n###### Office\\n\\n- Los Angeles\\n\\n# Advised on sale of premier provider of med spa treatments\\n\\n![Naked MD logo](https://www.stout.com/-/media/images/experience-logos/naked-md_web-logo.jpg?la=en&h=80&w=190&hash=6DEEA9C0FBB6FDEE23296C92E892CCB4)\\n\\n![Revelstoke Capital Partners](https://www.stout.com/-/media/images/experience-logos/revelstoke_web-logo.jpg?la=en&h=80&w=190&hash=A77B9E6ADC9C3DF610254DB91830C376)\\n\\nShare\\n\\n![linkedin sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/linkedin.svg)\\n\\n![twitter sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/twitter.svg)\\n\\n![print sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/print.svg)\\n\\n![email sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/email.svg)\\n\\n![sharethis sharing button](https://platform-cdn.sharethis.com/img/sharethis.svg)\\n\\nStout served as the exclusive financial advisor to NAKEDMD in connection with its sale to Revelstoke Capital Partners, a Denver-based private equity firm that invests in healthcare services, healthcare technology, and health and wellness companies.\\n\\nNAKEDMD, founded in 2022 and headquartered in Newport Beach, California, is a fast-growing, physician-led medical aesthetics company with a differentiated and branded service offering focused on quality of care and clinical compliance.
