When an operation is no longer utilizing a resource, or has seemingly exhausted the value of a product, those materials aren't disposed of, they're repurposed, finding their own second act as a resource and creating new value within a business and industry. The circular economy is key to smart business growth, and it's a proven way to reduce waste and even displace valuable environmental resources like coal.â\\n\\n![Frank Iezzi](data:image/svg+xml,%3Csvg%20xmlns='http://www.w3.org/2000/svg'%20viewBox='0%200%200%200'%3E%3C/svg%3E)\\n\\nFrank IezziChief Executive Officer, CIRCON Environmental\\n\\nâI have said it a million times.

Such Third-Party Ratings are conducted by persons and companies that are unaffiliated with Kinderhook and often use data including, but not limited to, fund performance data gathered through surveys, databases and other sources. Because the methodologies of these Third-Party Ratings are generally proprietary, it is not possible for Kinderhook to assess the universe of persons or firms considered, including an assessment of whether such firms are comparable to Kinderhook or whether the universe is complete. As a result, these Third-Party Ratings may not be an appropriate measure by which to assess the performance of any person or firm, and are not indicative of any one person or investorâs experience. Kinderhook may at times pay an application or participation fee, which is generally nominal, to apply for inclusion or consideration for such Third-Party Ratings.\\n\\nAny links to non- Kinderhook websites provided on this website, including links to portfolio company websites, are provided as a convenience and do not imply Kinderhookâs endorsement, sponsorship or approval of any of these websites or their content.
