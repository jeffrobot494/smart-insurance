The form5500_name_test tool uses inclusive search, so searching for 'Behavior Frontiers' will return 'Behavior Frontiers LLC', 'Behavior Frontiers Inc', etc. Use this search strategy: 1) Test the exact company name first 2) If no exact match, start with SHORTENED search terms for wider results: Remove common suffixes (LLC, Inc, Corp, Company, Co, Ltd) first, then try core business name only (e.g. 'Behavior Frontiers' instead of 'Behavior Frontiers Therapy Services LLC') 3) Then try common variations: Add/remove different legal suffixes; Remove punctuation and special characters; Try with/without 'The', 'A', 'An' articles 4) Record all matches found and their quality. The inclusive search means you should start broad and get specific, not the reverse. If a good match is found, return: {\"company_name\": \"Original Company Name\", \"firm_name\": \"PE Firm Name\", \"headquarters_location\": {...}, \"portfolio_verification\": {...}, \"employee_count_assessment\": {...}, \"form5500_match\": {\"legal_name\": \"Matched Legal Name\", \"ein\": \"12-3456789\", \"location\": \"City, State ZIP\", \"match_type\": \"exact/contains/partial\", \"record_count\": 5, \"variation_used\": \"variation tested\"}, \"status\": \"READY_FOR_EXTRACTION\"}. If no good match is found, return: {\"company_name\": \"Company Name\", \"firm_name\": \"PE Firm Name\", \"headquarters_location\": {...}, \"portfolio_verification\": {...}, \"employee_count_assessment\": {...}, \"form5500_attempts\": {\"variations_tested\": [\"Name\", \"Name LLC\", \"Name Inc\"], \"best_partial_matches\": [{\"legal_name\": \"Similar Name LLC\", \"match_type\": \"partial\", \"location\": \"Different City, ST\"}]}, \"status\": \"NEEDS_ADVANCED_RESOLUTION\"}. Use form5500_name_test multiple times as needed. Test systematic variations starting broad then getting specific. A 'good match' means exact or very close match with reasonable confidence. Document all variations attempted. Include only the formatted JSON in your response, exclude any other text or comments.\n\nInputs:\nemployee_count_check: {\n    \"company_name\": \"Tubby Todd Bath Co.\",\n    \"firm_name\": \"NexPhase Capital\",\n    \"headquarters_location\": {\n        \"city\": \"Carlsbad\",\n        \"state\": \"California\",\n        \"full_address\": \"1928 Kellogg Ave, Carlsbad, CA 92008\",\n        \"research_confidence\": \"high\"\n    },\n    \"portfolio_verification\": {\n        \"is_active_portfolio\": true,\n        \"verification_confidence\": \"high\",\n        \"investment_details\": \"NexPhase Capital acquired Tubby Todd Bath Co. in a buyout transaction\",\n        \"investment_date\": \"2022\",\n        \"status_notes\": \"Company remains active in NexPhase's portfolio as of 2024, confirmed by recent founder-friendly investors announcement featuring Tubby Todd's founder\"\n    },\n    \"employee_count_assessment\": {\n        \"likely_under_100_employees\": true,\n        \"confidence\": \"high\",\n        \"evidence\": \"Multiple business directories consistently show employee count in 10-50 range, with ZoomInfo and Salary.com listing <25 employees, and SignalHire showing 10-50 employees through 2024 into Q2 2025\",\n        \"year\": \"2024\"\n    },\n    \"status\": \"LIKELY_NO_FORM_5500\"\n}\n"
