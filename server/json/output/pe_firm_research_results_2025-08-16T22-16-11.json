      "Now I can see that the page has a filter option for \"Current\" investments. Based on the HTML structure and the content I've analyzed, I can identify the current portfolio companies.\n\nLooking at the descriptions of each company and the overall structure, I can determine that all the companies listed are current portfolio companies except for those specifically mentioned as exited investments. Since there's a filter for \"Current\" investments, all companies shown in the main listing are current unless otherwise indicated.\n\nHere's the JSON object with the firm name and current portfolio companies:\n\n```json\n{\n  \"firm\": \"Revelstoke Capital Partners\",\n  \"companies\": [\n    \"AOM Infusion\",\n    \"Carrus\",\n    \"CEI Vision Partners\",\n    \"ClareMedica Health Partners\",\n    \"Company Confidential\",\n    \"Crossroads Treatment Centers\",\n    \"DataLink\",\n    \"Empire Portfolio Group\",\n    \"Encore Rehabilitation\",\n    \"Evolve Med Spa\",\n    \"Family Care Center\",\n    \"Fast Pace\",\n    \"HealthAxis\",\n    \"MediQuant\",\n    \"Monte Nido\",\n    \"NAKED MD\",\n    \"Omega Systems\",\n    \"ONsite Mammography\",\n    \"OrthoAlliance\",\n    \"Rarebreed Veterinary Partners\",\n    \"Sound Physicians\",\n    \"The Care Team\",\n    \"Transport Investments\",\n    \"TridentUSA Health Services\",\n    \"U.S. Renal Care\",\n    \"Upstream Rehabilitation\",\n    \"Vet's Best Friend\"\n  ]\n}\n```"
