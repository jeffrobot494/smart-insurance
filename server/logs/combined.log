Since closing we identified and hired three c-suite executives, onboarded two invaluable industry board members, and executed a strategy to nearly double the headcount and revenue over 12 months.” ³\\n\\n#### Kevin Steele\\n\\n#### CEO of DATALINK\\n\\n![Dave Van Name](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2020/01/Dave-Van-Name-testimony-768x768.jpg)\\n\\n“Partnering with Revelstoke significantly accelerated our growth profile. In addition to capital, Revelstoke provided the additional resources, relationships and expertise needed to pursue transformative growth opportunities. Through a combination of organic growth, de novo development and multiple add-on acquisitions, our business has grown by approximately 4x since we partnered with Revelstoke.“ ³\\n\\n#### Dave Van Name\\n\\n#### Former CEO of UPSTREAM\\n\\n![Clyde Bell](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2020/01/Bell-Clyde-testimony-768x768.jpg)\\n\\n“We chose Revelstoke due to its culture, experience, strategic vision and value-creation process. In addition to having deep healthcare expertise, Revelstoke understands how to effectively partner with physician-led businesses. They are also great partners to management - willing to assist on any initiative or task. With Revelstoke’s help, we acquired 4 additional practices to our group in the first 8 months, nearly doubling the size of our business.“ ³\\n\\n#### Clyde Bell\\n\\n#### CEO of CVP\\n\\n![Greg Steil](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2020/01/Greg-Steil-testimony.jpg)\\n\\n“I have worked with Revelstoke and its partners on three transactions over ten years and have witnessed first-hand Revelstoke's commitment to a shared strategic vision and its willingness to invest in corporate infrastructure to help foster growth. Revelstoke possesses the rare mix of a deep expertise in healthcare, combined with patience, discipline and the willingness to proactively address any challenging issues head on.\\\" ³\\n\\n#### Greg Steil\\n\\n#### CEO of FAST PACE\\n\\nNext\\n\\n## 3 Testimonials and endorsements of operations team members, portfolio company executives and our partners are provided to demonstrate the benefits of working with the Revelstoke team. They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\n\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\"News\\\")\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": false\n}","tool_use_id":"toolu_01B1r5F9SThu8UHDEMqfLvqE","type":"tool_result"}],"role":"user"},{"content":[{"text":"Revelstoke Capital Partners: AOM Infusion, Carrus, CEI Vision Partners, ClareMedica Health Partners, Company Confidential, Crossroads Treatment Centers, DataLink, Empire Portfolio Group, Encore Rehabilitation, Evolve Med Spa, Family Care Center, Fast Pace, HealthAxis, MediQuant, Monte Nido, NAKED MD, Omega Systems, ONsite Mammography, OrthoAlliance, Rarebreed Veterinary Partners, Sound Physicians, The Care Team, Transport Investments, TridentUSA Health Services, U.S. Renal Care, Upstream Rehabilitation, Vet's Best Friend","type":"text"}],"role":"assistant"}],"outputKey":"portfolio_companies","result":"Revelstoke Capital Partners: AOM Infusion, Carrus, CEI Vision Partners, ClareMedica Health Partners, Company Confidential, Crossroads Treatment Centers, DataLink, Empire Portfolio Group, Encore Rehabilitation, Evolve Med Spa, Family Care Center, Fast Pace, HealthAxis, MediQuant, Monte Nido, NAKED MD, Omega Systems, ONsite Mammography, OrthoAlliance, Rarebreed Veterinary Partners, Sound Physicians, The Care Team, Transport Investments, TridentUSA Health Services, U.S. Renal Care, Upstream Rehabilitation, Vet's Best Friend","success":true,"taskId":4,"taskName":"ExtractCompanies"}},"workflowExecutionId":60},"level":"info","message":"Results:","service":"manager","timestamp":"2025-08-08T18:55:04.640Z"}

Only proceed if the previous task confirmed the company is an active portfolio investment (is_active_portfolio: true).

Search for information about company size, headcount, workforce, number of employees, or similar indicators. The criterion is whether it is more likely than not that the company had fewer than 100 employees in 2024. Companies with fewer than 100 employees typically do not file Form 5500 reports.

Search for information about company size, headcount, workforce, number of employees, or similar indicators. The criterion is whether it is more likely than not that the company had fewer than 100 employees in 2024. Companies with fewer than 100 employees typically do not file Form 5500 reports.

If the company likely had 100 or more employees in 2024, return: {\"company_name\": \"Company Name\", \"firm_name\": \"PE Firm Name\", \"headquarters_location\": {...}, \"portfolio_verification\": {...}, \"employee_count_assessment\": {\"likely_under_100_employees\": false, \"confidence\": \"high/medium/low\", \"evidence\": \"Brief description of evidence found\", \"year\": \"2024\"}, \"status\": \"PROCEED_TO_FORM_5500\"}. If the previous task showed the company is not an active portfolio investment, return: {\"company_name\": \"Company Name\", \"firm_name\": \"PE Firm Name\", \"reason\": \"Not an active portfolio company\", \"status\": \"SKIPPED\"}.

Search for information about company size, headcount, workforce, number of employees, or similar indicators. The criterion is whether it is more likely than not that the company had fewer than 100 employees in 2024. Companies with fewer than 100 employees typically do not file Form 5500 reports.

The form5500_name_test tool uses inclusive search, so searching for 'Behavior Frontiers' will return 'Behavior Frontiers LLC', 'Behavior Frontiers Inc', etc. Use this search strategy: 1) If the previous task found a legal entity name, test that name first 2) Test the original company name 3) If no exact match, start with SHORTENED search terms for wider results: Remove common suffixes (LLC, Inc, Corp, Company, Co, Ltd) first, then try core business name only (e.g. 'Behavior Frontiers' instead of 'Behavior Frontiers Therapy Services LLC') 4) Then try common variations: Add/remove different legal suffixes; Remove punctuation and special characters; Try with/without 'The', 'A', 'An' articles 5) Record all matches found and their quality. The inclusive search means you should start broad and get specific, not the reverse. If a good match is found, return: {\"company_name\": \"Original Company Name\", \"firm_name\": \"PE Firm Name\", \"headquarters_location\": {...}, \"portfolio_verification\": {...}, \"employee_count_assessment\": {...}, \"legal_entity_research\": {...}, \"form5500_match\": {\"legal_name\": \"Matched Legal Name\", \"ein\": \"12-3456789\", \"location\": \"City, State ZIP\", \"match_type\": \"exact/contains/partial\", \"record_count\": 5, \"variation_used\": \"variation tested\"}, \"status\": \"READY_FOR_EXTRACTION\"}.
