You want a precise match, not similar-sounding companies. Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching.

Wofford Advisors served as strategic advisor to Astira, while Kirkland & Ellis provided legal counsel to Astira.\\n\\n‍\\n\\n**About Astira Capital Partners**\\n\\n‍\\n\\nAstira Capital Partners is a Boston-based private equity firm founded in 2023 by Azra Kanji and investing out of a $675 million Fund 1.

The company's innovative capabilities and steadfast commitment to excellence perfectly align with Astira's investment philosophy.\\\"\\n\\n‍\\n\\nLinda Barros, Chief Executive Officer of ConData, stated, “We look forward to our new partnership with Astira. The team at Astira has significant experience partnering with businesses like ConData, and they demonstrated an appreciation for the opportunities and challenges ahead for the Company as we continue to scale. Astira’s focus on value-added operational and strategic support will accelerate our growth plans for the Company. There is tremendous runway for ConData, and we look forward to collaborating closely with Astira to drive innovation and deliver new insights and offerings for our customers.”\\n\\n‍\\n\\nThe acquisition process was supported by Harris Williams, who served as the sole financial advisor to ConData, and Baker Hostetler, who acted as legal advisor to ConData. Wofford Advisors served as strategic advisor to Astira, while Kirkland & Ellis provided legal counsel to Astira.\\n\\n‍\\n\\n**About Astira Capital Partners**\\n\\n‍\\n\\nAstira Capital Partners is a Boston-based private equity firm founded in 2023 by Azra Kanji and investing out of a $675 million Fund 1.
