You want a precise match, not similar-sounding companies. Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching.

Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching. Return the best single match you find. Return JSON: {company_name, firm_name, headquarters_location, revenue_research, portfolio_verification, legal_entity_research, form5500_match: {legal_name, ein, location, match_type, record_count, variation_used}}.

You want a precise match, not similar-sounding companies. Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching. Return the best single match you find.

You want a precise match, not similar-sounding companies. Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching. Return the best single match you find. Return JSON: {company_name, firm_name, headquarters_location, revenue_research, portfolio_verification, legal_entity_research, form5500_match: {legal_name, ein, location, match_type, record_count, variation_used}}.

You want a precise match, not similar-sounding companies. Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching.

You want a precise match, not similar-sounding companies. Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching. Return the best single match you find.

You want a precise match, not similar-sounding companies. Search strategy: 1) Try the legal entity name from the previous task (if available) 2) Try the original company name 3) If no good matches, try variations (remove suffixes like Inc, Corp, LLC). Evaluation criteria (in priority order): - EXACT name match + location match is perfect - EXACT name match (ignore location if name is very specific) - Company name + business suffix with location match (e.g., 'Apple Inc' in Cupertino) - Company name + business suffix (location mismatch acceptable if name is distinctive) - NEVER accept similar-sounding companies (e.g., 'Animax' is not 'Imax'). Location verification: - Use the headquarters city/state from previous research to validate matches - If a company name matches but location is completely different (different state), be skeptical - Common business locations (NYC, Delaware, etc.) are less reliable for verification - If uncertain between multiple matches, prefer the one with matching location. Quality control: - If no clear match exists, it's better to report no match than a wrong match - Document your reasoning in match_type field. Use form5500_batch_name_test for searching. Return the best single match you find.
