Before co-founding ADC, he was a Partner at Moelis & Company and focused on clients in the technology and business services sector. Brian completed numerous mergers & acquisitions and a number of successful merchant banking transactions while at Moelis & Company, including UELS and North American Partners in Anesthesia (NAPA). UELS, acquired in July 2011 with an initial equity investment of $26.9 million, was sold to Norwest Equity Partners in August 2014. Moelis Capital Partners (MCP) realized gross proceeds of $149 million (including dividends), equating to a 4.0x multiple of invested capital and a 75% IRR. MCP successor NexPhase Capital sold NAPA to American Securities in April 2016, realizing a 3.8x multiple and a 35% IRR on an initial equity check of $59 million.\\\\n\\\\nPrior to joining Moelis & Company, Brian was Global Head of Technology Investment Banking at UBS Investment Bank, where he oversaw UBS’ technology investment banking business on a global basis with a focus on the following sectors: software, communications, internet, semiconductors, business services, and outsourced manufacturing and distribution.

Before becoming Global Head of Technology Investment Banking, Brian ran the technology and business services vertical within the broader group. Brian joined UBS from Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette (DLJ) in 2001, following the sale of DLJ to Credit Suisse.\\\\n\\\\nAt DLJ, Brian co-founded the firm’s technology group and worked on a number of significant IPOs, high-yield, merger & acquisition and merchant banking transactions primarily in the technology sector. Under Brian’s management, DLJ commanded a leading market share in software and technology services for 6 years, and resulted in Brian being promoted to Managing Director in just 7 years. Brian joined DLJ as an Associate in 1993 and interned for the firm during the summer of 1992. Brian began his career in industry at the Ford Motor Company in Product Development Engineering, and assisted on the first major re-engineering of the very successful original Taurus.\\\\n\\\\nBrian graduated with an MBA from Harvard Business School (HBS) in 1993.
