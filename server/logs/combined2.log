Since closing we identified and hired three c-suite executives, onboarded two invaluable industry board members, and executed a strategy to nearly double the headcount and revenue over 12 months.‚Äù ¬≥\\\\n\\\\n#### Kevin Steele\\\\n\\\\n#### CEO of DATALINK\\\\n\\\\n![Dave Van Name](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2020/01/Dave-Van-Name-testimony-768x768.jpg)\\\\n\\\\n‚ÄúPartnering with Revelstoke significantly accelerated our growth profile.

They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\\\n\\\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\\\\\"News\\\\\\\")\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"isError\\\": false\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"I need to identify which companies are current/active investments versus exited investments.

They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\\\n\\\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\\\\\"News\\\\\\\")\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"isError\\\": false\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"I need to identify which companies are current/active investments versus exited investments.

They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\\\n\\\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\\\\\"News\\\\\\\")\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"isError\\\": false\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"I need to identify which companies are current/active investments versus exited investments.

Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\\\n\\\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\\\\\"News\\\\\\\")\\\\n\\\\nURL: https://www.revelstokecapital.com/\\\\nTitle: Revelstoke Capital Partners | Healthcare Private Equity Firm\\\\nDescription: Revelstoke Capital Partners ; 40,000.

Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\\\n\\\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\\\\\"News\\\\\\\")\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"isError\\\": false\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  }\n]","service":"temporary","timestamp":"2025-08-16T21:54:50.817Z"}

They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\\\n\\\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\\\\\"News\\\\\\\")\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"isError\\\": false\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"I need to identify which companies are current/active investments versus exited investments.

No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement.

Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\\\n\\\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\\\\\"News\\\\\\\")\\\"\\n    }\\n  ],\\n  \\\"isError\\\": false\\n}\"\n      }\n    ]\n  },\n  {\n    \"role\": \"assistant\",\n    \"content\": [\n      {\n        \"type\": \"text\",\n        \"text\": \"I need to identify which companies are current/active investments versus exited investments.

No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement.

They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\n\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\"News\\\")\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": false\n}","tool_use_id":"toolu_01EiNinEYygMCDQ4iZRFkC4R","type":"tool_result"}],"role":"user"},{"content":[{"text":"I need to identify which companies are current/active investments versus exited investments.

Revelstoke possesses the rare mix of a deep expertise in healthcare, combined with patience, discipline and the willingness to proactively address any challenging issues head on.\\\" ¬≥\\n\\n#### Greg Steil\\n\\n#### CEO of FAST PACE\\n\\nNext\\n\\n## 3 Testimonials and endorsements of operations team members, portfolio company executives and our partners are provided to demonstrate the benefits of working with the Revelstoke team. They are not provided to solicit investors in a Revelstoke fund. Some executives have an interest in a Revelstoke fund or a portfolio company. Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their company is owned or partially owned by a Revelstoke fund.\\n\\n[News![News](https://www.revelstokecapital.com//app/uploads/2019/12/revelstoke-icon-arrow-white-144.png)](https://www.revelstokecapital.com/news/ \\\"News\\\")\"\n    }\n  ],\n  \"isError\": false\n}","tool_use_id":"toolu_01H2rfXSC3eHrRvzLpH7zTBC","type":"tool_result"}],"role":"user"},{"content":[{"text":"Based on my research, I need to determine which companies are current/active investments versus exited investments.
