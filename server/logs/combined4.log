With 191 employees across six locations in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic regions of the United States, the company delivers 24/7 IT support and cybersecurity services, including managed detection and response (MDR), cloud hosting, data protection, regulatory compliance, and virtual CISO consulting.\\\\n\\\\n#### Table of Contents\\\\n\\\\n[The challenge: Disparate password management tools and lack of standardization](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/#the-challenge-disparate-password-management-tools-and-lack-of-standardization)\\\\n\\\\n[The solution: Standardizing on Bitwarden for scalability and security](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/#the-solution-standardizing-on-bitwarden-for-scalability-and-security)\\\\n\\\\n[Scaling secure access during rapid growth](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/#scaling-secure-access-during-rapid-growth)\\\\n\\\\n[Enhancing security through adoption and user-centered design](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/#enhancing-security-through-adoption-and-user-centered-design)\\\\n\\\\n## [](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/\\\\\\\\#the-challenge-disparate-password-management-tools-and-lack-of-standardization \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\#the-challenge-disparate-password-management-tools-and-lack-of-standardization\\\\\\\") The challenge: Disparate password management tools and lack of standardization\\\\n\\\\nBefore adopting Bitwarden, Omega Systems relied on a fragmented mix of tools, including KeePass, browser-based password managers, and other password managers  like LastPass and Keeper, often inherited through acquisitions. With no unified solution or corporate mandate, credential management became increasingly complex and unsustainable, resulting in tool sprawl and increased risk.\\\\n\\\\n## [](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/\\\\\\\\#the-solution-standardizing-on-bitwarden-for-scalability-and-security \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\#the-solution-standardizing-on-bitwarden-for-scalability-and-security\\\\\\\") The solution: Standardizing on Bitwarden for scalability and security\\\\n\\\\nDuring the proof-of-concept phase, Omega Systems evaluated several solutions, including NordPass and LastPass, but ultimately chose Bitwarden as its enterprise-wide password manager, citing several key advantages.\\\\n\\\\n- **Transparency through open source**: The trusted Bitwarden open source architecture provides Omega Systems with full visibility into the codebase, aligning with its security-first philosophy and fostering confidence, control, and trust across the organization.\\\\n\\\\n- **Streamlined onboarding and user lifecycle management**: Comprehensive documentation and SCIM integration enabled Omega to accelerate user onboarding and offboarding, reduce manual errors, and enhance internal alignment on credential management processes.\\\\n\\\\n- **Flexible deployment and centralized client management**: Bitwarden hybrid deployment options support both cloud and self-hosted environments, giving Omega the flexibility to serve distributed teams and regulated industries, while the provider portal allows centralized control over client environments.\\\\n\\\\n- **Seamless integration with core security tools**: Bitwarden integrates with key systems in the Omega stack—including Duo for SSO, Adlumin for MDR, and Microsoft Entra ID—ensuring consistent identity and threat management across the entire security infrastructure.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n**Granular access control with clear auditability**: Credentials are logically grouped into collections based on roles and departments, supporting least privilege access and making it easy for Omega to audit and manage who has access to specific resources.\\\\n\\\\n#### Read more:\\\\n\\\\n[Why open source delivers transparency and security for enterprises](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/blog/why-open-source-delivers-transparency-and-security-for-enterprises/)\\\\n\\\\n## [](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/\\\\\\\\#scaling-secure-access-during-rapid-growth \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\#scaling-secure-access-during-rapid-growth\\\\\\\") Scaling secure access during rapid growth\\\\n\\\\nWith Omega continuing to grow both organically and through acquisitions, centralizing access management has become a top priority. Bitwarden plays a critical role in this strategy, providing a unified and scalable solution for managing credentials across new business units.\\\\n\\\\nThe team is currently completing its fourth deployment within an acquired company, underscoring the ability for Bitwarden to scale consistently across a growing organization. By standardizing credential management, Omega is strengthening its security posture while enabling smoother transitions during periods of expansion.\\\\n\\\\n#### Read more:\\\\n\\\\n[How to foster user adoption for your new company password manager](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/blog/user-adoption-for-company-password-manager/)\\\\n\\\\n## [](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/\\\\\\\\#enhancing-security-through-adoption-and-user-centered-design \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\#enhancing-security-through-adoption-and-user-centered-design\\\\\\\") Enhancing security through adoption and user-centered design\\\\n\\\\nTo uphold strong security practices across the organization, Omega has made Bitwarden adoption a standard requirement. As part of this initiative, native browser password storage has been disabled to ensure all employees use a centralized, secure solution for managing credentials.\\\\n\\\\nEmployees report a significantly better experience using Bitwarden. The intuitive browser extension, combined with time-saving features like autofill and secure credential sharing through Bitwarden Send, has made daily workflows more efficient. The platform’s passkey functionality is also receiving praise for its smooth performance. One employee shared, “As a heavy passkey user, Bitwarden has made the passkey experience seamless across systems and devices.”\\\\n\\\\nMobile usability is another standout feature. The Bitwarden mobile app delivers a seamless experience, complementing the desktop and browser integrations. Additionally, users value the inclusion of a complimentary family plan available through the Enterprise tier, extending secure practices beyond the workplace.\\\\n\\\\n> “As a heavy passkey user, Bitwarden has made the passkey experience seamless across systems and devices.”\\\\n\\\\nOmega Systems employee\\\\n\\\\n## [](https://bitwarden.com/de-de/resources/omega-systems-enhances-enterprise-security-and-user-experience/\\\\\\\\#get-started-with-bitwarden \\\\\\\"\\\\\\\\#get-started-with-bitwarden\\\\\\\") Get started with Bitwarden\\\\n\\\\nBy deploying Bitwarden, Omega Systems has consolidated their approach to password management, enhanced employee usability, and strengthened their cybersecurity posture.
