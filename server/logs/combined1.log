The company really focuses on creating opportunities for everyone to come together in person or remotely so we can continue to foster an amazing culture.

Soon after they opened an offshore office in India and we were expected to provide documentation for the offshore teams. Later that year, it was announced no bonuses were going to be handed out and instead would be announced end of Q1. During a Q4 townhall, CEO was asked if we should be concerned about layoffs with the opening of an offshore office, and he said no layoffs will occur and our jobs are secure. Fast forward to January 2023, and layoffs hit - CEO nowhere to be found on the calls. Makes sense why they delayed bonuses - anticipating layoffsanticipating layoffsanticipatinginging layoffs meant they don't have to pay out. Duplicitous, shady and reprehensible layoff rollout. Also backed by VC money, so combine that with cowardly leadership and avoid like the plague.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow more\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHelpful\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShare\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n11\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJoin the DataLink Software team\\\\n\\\\n[See Our Latest Jobs](https://www.glassdoor.com/Jobs/DataLink-Software-Jobs-E2395768.htm)\\\\n\\\\n4. 2.0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJan 17, 2025\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[**Not much left to look forward to**](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-DataLink-Software-E2395768-RVW94420150.htm)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAnonymous employee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFormer employee, more than 10 years\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecommend\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCEO approval\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBusiness outlook\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nThe teams I worked with were composed of talented, responsive individuals who genuinely cared about their work and were dedicated to supporting each other‚Äôs success.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nAfter the founder left to pursue a career in politics using the wealth we helped him build, leadership at this company seems to have lost focus on the core mission and values that originally inspired them to work here. Rather than taking the time to understand the teams, processes, and workflows, they implemented frequent organizational shake-ups that created instability and hindered team success.\\\\n\\\\nIn addition to these constant changes, the company opened an offshore office in India, hiring dozens of employees with the claim that this team would supplement our efforts, coupled with a promise that they were not hired to replace us. However, it quickly became clear that their real intention was to offshore our work to save money, not to support growth. By investing time and resources into training these employees‚Äîmany of whom struggled to adapt to the complexity of the work‚Äîwe missed key opportunities for real growth. Our products were exclusively focused on American healthcare systems and processes, making the offshoring decision not only inefficient but also deeply frustrating and offensive to those of us who were dedicated to the company‚Äôs success.\\\\n\\\\nProject goals were often poorly defined before being handed to development teams, resulting in confusion, errors, and inefficiencies. A lack of strategic foresight regarding the evolving healthcare market led to missed opportunities for innovation and, ultimately, customer attrition. Even when projects were completed successfully‚Äîdespite vague direction‚Äîthey were frequently dismissed as 'band-aid' solutions, undermining the effort and impact of the teams involved.\\\\n\\\\nThese leadership failures from the C-suite resulted in the loss of key clients and, ultimately, layoffs that affected employees who had dedicated years‚Äîsometimes decades‚Äîto the company, myself included. Despite this, almost none of the leaders responsible for these missteps were let go. It is disheartening to see hardworking employees who upheld the company‚Äôs values dismissed, while those accountable for the failures remained in place.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow more\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHelpful\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShare\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n5. 3.0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nMar 31, 2025\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[**Worst company**](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-DataLink-Software-E2395768-RVW96312107.htm)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nData engineer\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nFormer employee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHyderƒÅbƒÅd\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecommend\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCEO approval\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBusiness outlook\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n4 layoff in a year\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBad environment and no proper management\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHelpful\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShare\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n7. 4.0\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nJan 15, 2024\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n[**Great leadership**](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/Employee-Review-DataLink-Software-E2395768-RVW83390579.htm)\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nTeam lead\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCurrent employee\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecommend\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCEO approval\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nBusiness outlook\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nPros\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nA clear futuristic vision towards innovation and product development to support ever changing health care ecosystem\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nCons\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nRecent layoffs might have been a bit drastic, but were needed to stay relevant and be competitive.\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShow more\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nHelpful\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nShare\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n\\\\n1\\\\n\\\\n\\\\nViewing 1 - 8 of 8 Reviews\\\\n\\\\n[Reviews>](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/index.htm)\\\\n\\\\n[DataLink Software](https://www.glassdoor.com/Reviews/DataLink-Software-Reviews-E2395768.htm)\\\\n\\\\n## DataLink Software reviews FAQs\\\\n\\\\n- Does DataLink Software pay their employees well?According to anonymously submitted Glassdoor reviews, DataLink Software employees rate their compensation and benefits as 3.7 out of 5.
