Operations team members and Revelstoke partners receive a salary and/or economics from Revelstoke and portfolio company executives receive a salary and economics from the respective portfolio company. No executives were paid for their testimonial or endorsement. There is a conflict of interest in these unpaid testimonials and endorsements in that all executives stand to benefit from Revelstoke's success and for portfolio company executives specifically, their
