HEALTH INSURANCE APP QUESTIONS
1) Q: Can we use perplexity to find the companies these companies own?
A: Perplexity Deep Research is fucking CRUSHING it. Way better than trying to scrape ourselves. Which also is probably less up to date.

2) Is there a tool we can use to get the labor results? apparently the API works? I thought it was down or something... If the API works, and gets us all the info we need, we are fucking golden. 

3) How do we get the company's EIN? Probably a basic perplexity search. Or maybe our Deep Research can get us the EIN at the same time. 
Look up name and EIN in the Form 5500 2023.csv
