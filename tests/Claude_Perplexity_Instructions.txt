Instructions for Claude on how to use Perplexity.ai. 

Perplexity is an internet research tool. It has three modes: Search, Research, and Labs. 

Search is for simple queries. Research is for complex queries and generates reports. Labs is for creating applications. 

Our queries require an intelligent series of searches so we want to use Research. 

The mode is chosen by clicking the corresponding button underneath the text input area. There are three buttons, one for each mode. 

Research and Labs modes are only available to Perplexity Pro users. If the user is not logged in, or the user is logged in but is not a Pro user, these buttons are disabled and can't be clicked. If a Pro user is logged in, they are enabled and can be clicked. 

After selecting Research mode, you should enter the query in the text input field, then press Enter or click the submit button. 

Perplexity will begin its research take. This can take up to 30 minutes. 

You should take a snapshot (not a screenshot) every 20 seconds to check if research has completed. 

You will know that research has completed when the query you entered is displayed at the top of the page in large font and there is no text indicating "I am researching" or "I need to find" etc, which presence indicates Perplexity is still researching. 

Once you see that Perplexity has finished, take a snapshot of the research results.
